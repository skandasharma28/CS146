#Used prims algorithm of MSTs to solve this.

#Created adj matrix and initilaized it with neg inf
#Main change I implemented here was that since there was no house at 0 index ( houses started from 1), I created a 0 house which represents the wells
#Bascailly, any connection to the 0th house to a nth house, means that house needs a well
# This was atleast 1 house has a well

#Finally I ran Prims on this updated adj matrix
