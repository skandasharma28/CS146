# Used a slightly differernt approach for java and python as I was not fully sure which implementation was right.
# In java, I tried to traverse through the left of the BST and then right of the BST while actively comparing the values to see if the tree is valid or not
# In python I used a couple of other conidtions to better help me traverse through the BST 
# I am fully not sure if either approach is right, but this was my best effort.
