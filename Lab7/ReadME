# I used  Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find shortest paths from each of cities to all the other cities, in order to solve this problem.
#I broke it down into 4 parts

#Part 1: I created a distance 2D array which shows the distance between each city
# I populated it with 0 (distance between same city) and inf (distance between different cities)

#Part 2: I populated the accurate distance information from the edges 2d array paramater
# Since this is a undirected graph, to and from are the same as from and to distances

#Part 3: Used Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find shortest paths from each of cities to all the other cities

#Part 4: Checked for the city with the least number of connections given the distance threshold constraint 
# Returned the greater city if there was a tie between 2 cities for the least number of connections.
